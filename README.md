This README file outlines the functionalities and logic behind the code for the Notes app built using MVVM and Room Database in Android Studio with Kotlin.

Functionalities:

Add notes: Create new notes with titles and descriptions.
Display notes: View all existing notes in a staggered layout.
Edit notes: Modify the titles and descriptions of existing notes.
Delete notes: Remove unwanted notes from the app.
Search notes: Find notes based on keywords in their titles or descriptions.


Technical Stack:

Android Studio: The integrated development environment (IDE) used for building Android apps.
Kotlin: The programming language used for developing the app.
MVVM: Model-View-ViewModel architecture for separating UI, data, and business logic.
Room Database: A persistence library for storing and managing data on the device.

Logic Breakdown:

Entity: The Note class defines the structure of a note with attributes like title and description.
DAO (Data Access Object): The NotesDao interface provides methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on notes stored in the Room Database.
Repository: The NotesRepository class manages access to the NotesDao and provides a single source of truth for note data.
ViewModel: The NotesViewModel class exposes observable data and methods for interacting with notes through the repository.

Fragments:
HomeFragment: Displays the list of notes and handles search functionality.
AddNoteFragment: Provides UI for adding new notes.
EditNoteFragment: Allows editing existing notes and includes delete functionality.

Additional Notes:

The app utilizes data binding for simplified UI-to-data communication.
Navigation components are used for handling fragment navigation.

I hope this README file provides a clear overview of the Notes app's functionalities and underlying logic. Feel free to explore the source code for further details and customization.
